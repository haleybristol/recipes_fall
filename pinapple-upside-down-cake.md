1/4
cup butter or margarine 
2/3
cup packed brown sugar
9
slices pineapple in juice (from 14-oz can), drained
9
maraschino cherries without stems, if desired
1 1/3
cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour
1
cup granulated sugar 
1/3
cup shortening
1 1/2
teaspoons baking powder
1/2
teaspoon salt
3/4
cup milk 
1

1 Heat oven to 350°F. In 9-inch square pan, melt butter in oven. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over melted butter. Arrange pineapple slices over brown sugar. Place cherry in center of each pineapple slice.
2 In medium bowl, beat remaining ingredients with electric mixer on low speed 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat on high speed 3 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour batter over pineapple and cherries.
3 Bake 50 to 55 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Immediately place heatproof serving plate upside down over pan; turn plate and pan over. Leave pan over cake a few minutes so brown sugar mixture can drizzle over cake; remove pan. Serve warm. Store cake loosely covered.
